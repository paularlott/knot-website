## Users

Users can be created and managed in the Knot web interface. Users can be assigned groups and roles to control access to resources and features within knot.

Each user can be given a resource quota to limit the number of spaces that can be created or run simultaneously.

## Groups

Groups are used to control access to templates.

Users can only see templates and create spaces from the template if the template belongs to one of the groups that the user is a member of.

## Roles

Roles are used to control access to features within knot. Roles are assigned one or more permissions.

When multiple roles are assigned to a user, the permissions from all roles are combined.
