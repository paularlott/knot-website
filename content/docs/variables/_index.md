In **knot**, variables are used within job and volume templates to provide flexibility and customization. There are three types of variables available:

- **System Variables**:
  Automatically defined by **knot** at runtime.

- **User-Defined Variables**:
  Created and managed within the **knot** web interface.

- **Custom Variables**:
  Defined by templates, with values set when a space is created. Each space can have unique values for these variables.
