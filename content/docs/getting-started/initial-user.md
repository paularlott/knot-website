Once the server has been deployed point the browser at the URL defined in the configuration file, the following form will be presented:

{{< picture src="../create-admin-user.webp" caption="Initial User Setup" >}}

NOTE: In multiple server mode the Origin Server must be used to initialize the admin user.

Once the form has been completed a new user will be created within the database and installation will be completed. Once the login screen will be presented the user can be used to access the system.

After logging into the system clicking the username in the top right will show the user profile, the profile should be checked and adjusted as required e.g. setting the timezone.
