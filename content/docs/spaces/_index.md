Spaces are user-specific instances of templates, providing private environments for development or other tasks. Each space is created and owned by the user, ensuring isolation and control.

### Compute Units and Space Limits

- **Running Spaces**:
  Running spaces consume the user's allocated Compute Units. Users can run multiple spaces simultaneously, as long as they stay within their Compute Unit limits.

- **Stopped Spaces**:
  Stopped spaces do not count against the user's Compute Units, allowing users to pause environments without impacting their resource allocation.
