### Important Notes

- Once the space is transferred, it will no longer be available to the original user.
- Only **stopped spaces** can be transferred. If the space is running, the transfer option will not be available.

{{< tip >}}
To give another user access to a running space without stopping it, use the **`Share`** space option instead.

Ensure the target user's name is clicked in the dropdown list to confirm the selection.
