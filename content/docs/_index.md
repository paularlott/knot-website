To make use of knot, a Nomad cluster is required. knot is designed to deploy developer environments directly to this cluster, ensuring a seamless workflow. It offers dual accessibility through both a web interface and command line interface (CLI) to these environments, providing developers with flexibility and control.

With knot, developers have the ability to initiate, pause and terminate environments as needed. This feature is particularly useful in managing resources effectively. Additionally, all data is stored in persistent volumes that are managed by knot and nomad, offering an added layer of convenience.
